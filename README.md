# Shehar-s_Currency_Convertor
My semester project for the Web Programming course.
<br>

This project is a modern, user-friendly currency converter that lets us convert any amount between supported currencies using PKR (Pakistani Rupee) as the base reference.

<br><br>

<bold>How It Works:</bold>
Select <strong>"From Currency":</strong> Choose the currency we currently have.
<br>
Select <strong>"To Currency":</strong> Choose the currency we want to convert to.
<br>
<strong>Enter Amount:</strong> Type the amount we'd like to convert.
<br>
Click <strong>"Convert":</strong> A result modal will appear in the center of our screen with the converted value.
<br>
Click <strong>"Use Again":</strong> This closes the modal, resets the form, and lets us make another conversion.
<br>
<strong>Conversion History:</strong> All conversions are saved on the right panel. We can review or delete individual entries easily.

<br>
The app supports real-time conversions between multiple currencies using preset exchange rates. The entire interface is sleek, responsive, and tailored for an engaging experience, perfect for quick conversions, with a focus on PKR as the main calculation unit.
