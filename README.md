# Shehar-s_Currency_Convertor
My semester project for the Web Programming course.
<br>

This project is a simple currency converter. It allows you to convert an amount from one currency to another.
<br><br>
Here's how it works:
<br><br>
Select <strong>"Dropping This":</strong> Choose the currency you have.<br>
Select <strong>"Grabbing That":</strong> Choose the currency you want to convert to.<br>
<strong>Enter Amount:</strong> Type in the amount of money you want to convert.<br>
Click <strong>"Show Me the Money!":</strong> The converted amount will appear in a pop-up window.<br>
<strong>"Use Again"</strong> button: Click this to close the pop-up and perform another conversion.<br>
The converter includes exchange rates for several currencies, with Pakistani Rupee (PKR) as the base.
